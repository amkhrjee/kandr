We generally use the term _parameter_ for a variable named in the parenthesized list in a function definition, and _argument_ for the value used in a call of the function.

The terms _formal argument_ and _actual argument_ are used for the same distinction. 

When the name of an argument is used as an argument, the value passed to the function is the location or address of the beginning of the array - there is no copying of array elements.
