# Welcome to my K&R Notes!

This repo contains my personal notes and solutions to (some) exercises given in the book. 

You might have seen heated arguments on the internet about how the coding practices demonstated in this book are not the very best to say the least, and how this book should be avoided by newcomers. I am nobody to judge, but, if I had to give my two cents, I definitely believe that this book is great for showing you all the hacky things you can do with the language, both logically and syntactically. While random hackeries in production code is bad, there's no harm in learning them, and from my experience, if you know what's "ninja code" and what's not, it gets easier to decide what style to follow in your actual production code. 

I've written these with the selfish goal of helping myself, but if you can extract somethingh of value out of this, it will give me great pleasure. 

Best of luck!
